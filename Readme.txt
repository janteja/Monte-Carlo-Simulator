This program performs montecarlo simulation on the data that is provided. 
I used data from stocks. ( monthly closing prices average ) https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=YHOO&a=03&b=12&c=1996&d=11&e=6&f=2015&g=m
Copy pase the data into the data.txt file
run the program.
program will ask you for how many times to run it Enter Betweeen 300 to 1000 . ( more  = acurate )
Then it will graph the data. 

Please see the formula.xlsx to see the steps performed to get the average.
